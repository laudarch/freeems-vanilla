 * @brief Struct typedefs for tunable configuration
 *
 * This file contains both the struct data type definitions and the arrays of
 * default values for small tables. Place reusable definitions of default table
 * values in here such that they can be used in multiple tunable table definitions.
 *
 * You should add your configuration item here if it is best that it is adjusted with
 * instant results on a running engine. For everything else, please consider placing
 * it in one of the fixed configuration structs.
